# DevQuest


#Random Thoughts
- Character Stats(i.e. HTML,Javascript, C#, etc.) or based on learning path level
- -Level Cap, maybe 50.
- Learning Paths(i.e. Git, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C#)
  - Could be like "Choose your hero" or different traits that your character has, each "challenge" can give you points to one or more
  - could also just be armor that you wear to enhance your traits, like "I am Level 12(only based on points) and I have the JS skills at 50 and C# skills at 3.
  - certain challenges may require a minimum/maximum level and also min skills in specific traits 
- points earned(xp) and maybe something else that can be redeemed IRL.
- can be awarded items in the game (by mentor or by team-lead) that can increase in-game skills. 
  - i.e. Boots of C# Unit Tests give you +7 c# skills ( this could allow you to do challenges outside your technical level)
  - i.e. Time Gem gives you 1 extra minute on timed challenges. ("infinity" gems hidden in boss levels) or won in head to head challenges, only one owner of each gem in the entire game at any given time.
- Based on doing challenges and earning points, points go toward level.
- Certain levels and ways of beating the challenge will get awards (possibly in-game badges and in ServiceNow)
  - Possible like writing clean code
  - time to finish challenge (fastest time of all people)
- head to head challenges
- player created challenges
- challenges with a group over a time period(week long dev challenge)
- quest-line you have to follow to beat the "bosses" harder code challenges that must be done with a proctor
- quests that you can pick up by finding them inside in-game awards or hidden within challenges (add to level and awards but you still have to follow the main quest line to get win the story
- challenges can either be auto approved based on some output testing or manual approval that has to be looked over, possibly written in-front of, some proctor.
